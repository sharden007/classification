This Python script implements a classification workflow to predict a target variable, specifically the Recommended Product for customers, based on their demographic and purchasing behavior. The script uses machine learning models (Random Forest and Decision Tree classifiers) to train and evaluate the predictions. This application allows you to compare both classifiers 
 product recommendations based on customer profiles!

Main Workflow:
The main function orchestrates the entire process:
-Loads data.
-Ensures the target column exists.
-Preprocesses data.
-Splits it into training and testing sets.
-Trains and evaluates both Decision Tree and Random Forest models.
-Saves predictions for both models to separate CSV files.


Use Cases
This script is designed for classification tasks and can be adapted for multiple real-world scenarios:

Product Recommendation Systems:
Predict which product(s) to recommend to customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic information.
Useful for retail businesses like Starbucks to personalize recommendations.

Customer Segmentation:
Classify customers into different segments (e.g., based on their preferences or spending habits).
Helps businesses target specific customer groups with tailored marketing campaigns.

Behavioral Analysis:
Analyze how features like age, visit frequency, or product preferences influence customer choices.
Provides insights into customer behavior trends.

Decision Support in Retail:
Use predictions to optimize inventory by stocking more of the recommended products for specific customer demographics.
Output
Console:
Displays accuracy scores and classification reports for both models.

CSV Files:
decision_tree_predictions.csv: Contains test data with actual and predicted labels from the Decision Tree classifier.
random_forest_predictions.csv: Contains test data with actual and predicted labels from the Random Forest classifier.
